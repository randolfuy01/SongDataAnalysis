This is going to be the template we will be using for now.
Most of the work going to be done will be within the "container" id for our project. 
For the container id. There will be a convention we will follow:

h1 will show what that specified page is about.
<h1>example: Song Comparison</h1>

h3 will show specfic header for values.
<h3> Artist name or song Name</h3>
<form> This form will comparise of a selection form of the artists we have. 
    Just create the form, worry about displaying options later</form>

* Note that for the song comparison page we will have 2 separate areas. For example:
Left side for artist 1, Right side for artist 2 (same with song comparison); and because of this we will have 
2 forms for searching
For this:
    We will follow the same convention:
    <img of the artist>
    <h4> Artist/ Song name</h4>
    <p> description of the song or artist</p>
    <list> of numerical statistics </list>

    * We will implement the data/ image graphs later (next week)
    <a ref=""></a> link to the artist / their song on youtube 
    Note: For pages that have 2 values (artists and songs) you will have to implement this twice for each side. 
    If there is only 1 value, you will only have to implement it once. 
    Note: For now, for artist and description, song and description, just pick artists / songs you like and use those
    since this is just a static website for now. 
    I will include placeholder images as well for the graphs, data comparisons.
    
    * PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU FINISH *
    * by tuesday night next week, you should have met with me once to review code before pushing changes, 
    preferably before tuesday
    
Example Template for individual artist:
<div id = "container">
    <img *image of the artist placeholder for now>
    <h1> The Weeknd </h1>
    <p> The Weeknd is an artist that is known for his pop music ...
        ....
        ....
        ....
        * Can use chat gpt to generate a 3-4 sentence description of artist/song
    </p>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li> Air date: </li>
            <li> Artist real name: </li>
            <li> Artist Genre </li>
            <li> nationality </li>
            <li> popularity index *makeup for now</li>
            <li> link to music / artist </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</div>
    
* NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN COPY PASTE
* Won't work due to it essentially being sudo code, just gives you an outline of what to put inside
the container
